# Myopia Clusters

This Challenge is to apply unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups.

The data used for this challenge is from a medical research company thatâ€™s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. The goal is to find out whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups for effective analysis.
